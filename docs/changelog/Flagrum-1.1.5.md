## Flagrum 1.1.5

_Released 4 February 2022_

### New Features

- Added "Export with Dependencies" option that exports models with all textures and materials
- Added basic "Export" and "Export Folder" options for all file types
- Asset Explorer Game View added
>**NOTE**  
>For browsing game files without extraction (including preview of supported types). This allows you to browse the game files without ever extracting any files using asset paths instead of physical location so assets will be placed logically in the folders you expect

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where Model Replacement Mods were not rigging correctly
- Fixed a bug where MRS textures were expressing their effects slightly inaccurately in-game

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where parts of rigging could break on outfit mods when equipped on the older version of the main characters

> **Recommended Action**  
> If you have created any outfit mods, consider rebuilding them by opening the existing mod, selecting "Change Model," picking the same FMD you created the mod with, then clicking "Save" to rebuild.

- Fixed an issue where after updating, Flagrum would no longer nest under its shortcut icon when pinned to the taskbar

> **Recommended Action**  
> If you have Flagrum pinned to the taskbar, unpin and repin to resolve this issue for future updates.

- Flagrum will now launch with a smaller window on screens with a resolution smaller than the default window size

## Flagrum 1.5.0

_Released 2 October 2023_

### New Features

- Mod Patching

> **Important** - This update changes the way Flagrum applies mods to your game, so please read carefully!   
> Flagrum no longer needs to alter the original game files to apply mods to Final Fantasy XV! As such, you no longer need to worry about your game files being corrupted, even in the event of an unexpected bug. A new button has been added to the `Settings` tab that allows you to instantly reset your game back to its original condition. However, if your game was in a bad state prior to this update, you will still need to verify files or reinstall to fix it.

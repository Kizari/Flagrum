## Tests to consider creating

### Unit Tests

* Tests that execute all the basic functionality to ensure no exceptions have been introduced by changes

### Integration Tests

* Tests that read binary formats and write them, then compare the output to make sure they are the same
* Test that builds a Steam Workshop mod from a demo FMD file

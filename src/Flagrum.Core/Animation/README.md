# Format Information

### Animation Clip (*.ani)

Contains keyframe data for animations. While this format is fully mapped out in the Luminous Templates repository,
unfortunately it is not currently understood how these key frames map back to the respective bones.

### Animation Package (*.pka)

A container format for animation clips. Just a simple header followed by ANI files and nothing else.

### Animation Model (*.amdl)

Contains armature and rest pose information. Not everything in this file is currently understood, but it is
fully mapped out in the Luminous Templates repository.

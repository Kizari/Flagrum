This directory contains legacy code that is no longer wanted in the codebase, but needs to remain to be able
to migrate user data that is coming forward from older versions of Flagrum. There's no real timeframe on expiry
for this code, so it will either need to be kept indefinitely, or eventually disposed of in favour of simply
telling users that came from really old versions to just start over and deal with it.

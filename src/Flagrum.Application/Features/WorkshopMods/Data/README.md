### Information

The Steam Workshop mod system is very bugged and outdated. No effort is being put in to refactor these classes as
the intention is to phase this system out in favour of an alternative system where outfits and weapons can be
created easily through the Mod Manager. These classes are awful, but they are not worth more time and effort.
